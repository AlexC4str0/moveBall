# Move Ball  

DESCRIPTION:
    The main goal of this simple project was to get used to handling CSS elements through JavaScript. The visual representation of the moving ball happens in real time through the setInterval method which allows the page to update at the appropriate interval of time 



ROADMAP:
    I do intend on working forwards on this. My initial plan was to make a new bouncing ball on every bottom bounce. I plan to get comfortable in making my skills more modular which will make all my code more clear in general.
